A Cloud Based Machine Learning Web Application
L. Zheng

The code includes index.html, main.py, submit.php and upload.php. In index.html, the CSS style of .myButton is generated from https://www.bestcssbuttongenerator.com. In main.py, the code of plotting confusion matrix was changed from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_confusion_matrix.html. I also learned from scikit-learn documents for those four algorithms, but wrote the code by myself. The background picture is retrieved and edited from https://2d1inx1fq9jl3el9kuevt0cs-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Blue-White-full-width-background-02.png. All other codes are written by myself. 

I believe the web server which holds the web application is "cloud". I use AWS EC2 Ubuntu 18.04 spot instance, changed the inbound rules and other settings as we learned from the first assignment. In addition, I used budget services to alert me if I run out of the credits.

*The web application can be reached in http://ec2-35-175-216-244.compute-1.amazonaws.com or 35.175.216.244. (No longer avaliable)
